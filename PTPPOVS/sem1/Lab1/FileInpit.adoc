== Code Blocks

To include source code or configuration files, use the `----` or `....` delimiters for code blocks.

[source,c++]
----
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, AsciiDoc!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
----

Or, using the `....` delimiter:

....
print("This is a Python code block in AsciiDoc.")
....

== Tables

AsciiDoc also supports the creation of tables. Below is an example of a simple table:

[cols="1,2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Name   | Age   | Occupation
